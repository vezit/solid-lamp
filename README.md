Prototype of an app that helps you keep track of characters in a novel using artificial intelligence.

## Overview

The goal is a mobile application where you can photograph a page and ask questions about the story. For example, if you take a picture of page 83 and ask "Who is Theo?", the app will detect that this page belongs to chapter 6, scan the book up to that chapter and provide a short explanation of the character. You can then continue the conversation with further questions in the same context.

This repository currently holds a simple Python prototype. Run it with:

```
python app-main/helloworld.py
```

For now the script prints a greeting, but it forms the basis for future development.
